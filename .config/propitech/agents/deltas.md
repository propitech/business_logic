# business_logic — project agent rules

This is the repository's only hand-authored agent surface; the flattened
`AGENTS.md` appends it after the managed baseline (hash-pinned in
`agents.lock.json`), so rules here win. After editing, run `bin/agents-render`.

---

## Mission {#mission}

`business_logic` is a standalone Ruby gem that provides the
`BusinessLogic::Command` base class and dry-rb integrations consumed by
Propitech Rails apps (`property_management`, `dance_school`). It is a library
— no web layer, no database. The public API is a contract; changes that break
callers require a coordinated version bump across all consumers.

## Workflow (business_logic additions) {#workflow-bl}

On top of [base.md#workflow] (which already mandates the `ai/<type>/<slug>`
branch name and tracking work in Linear):

- There is no Kamal deploy. A release is a gem publish (`gem push`) after a
  version bump in the gemspec.
- Before a breaking public-API change, validate the gem against
  `../property_management` and `../dance_school`: run their test suites with
  the local gem path-substituted in their `Gemfile`.

## References {#references}

- [README.md](README.md) — public API documentation.
- Consumer repos: `../property_management`, `../dance_school`.
- Work tracking: **Linear** (Propitech workspace, team `PRO`) — see [base.md#plans].
